## Features & Implementation

Feed the Cats plays much like whack a mole but, instead of whacking, we are feeding. The game utilizes the Enchant JS library. The game is not time based but instead each game is fixed with number of chances the player get to feed.

The game area turns the user's mouse pointer to a cat treat. Every element in the game is related to a cat theme, from the boxes with holes to the ending screen (saying "nap time"), instead of outputting "game over". After the cats appears for the fixed number of times, the game is over.

## Future Dirctions for the Project

There are many additional features in the plan, such as sound and different mode of challenges. Another more time consuming addition would be to add other animals (such as mice).

Adding other animals can turn the game to end after feeding the any non-cat animals a certain times.
